## Application Introduction
We have developed an application that allows employers to track the work schedule of their employees. The application features a user-friendly interface that enables employers to easily view their employees' working hours at a glance. Additionally, employees can input their own work hours using a simple and intuitive interface.

## Usage
To use the application, employers can create an account and add their employees to the system. Once added, employers can view each employee's work schedule, including start and end times, breaks, and total hours worked. Employees can also log in to the system and input their own work hours, which can be reviewed and approved by their employer.

## Technology Used
This application was built using Ruby on Rails, with a PostgreSQL database to store employee and schedule data. Front-end development was done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application also utilizes the Devise gem for user authentication and the Simple Form gem for form creation.

## Installation
To install and run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run bundle install to install the necessary gems.
Run rails db:migrate to create the database tables.
Start the server by running rails server and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.
